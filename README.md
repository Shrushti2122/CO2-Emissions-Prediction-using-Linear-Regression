### CO2-Emissions-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
#### This project uses Linear Regression to predict vehicle CO2 emissions based on engine size, fuel consumption, and transmission type. It includes data analysis, model training, and performance evaluation, with techniques to reduce overfitting. Insights can guide fuel efficiency improvements and environmental policies.
